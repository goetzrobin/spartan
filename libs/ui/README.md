# UI library

## Overall Architecture

Components are made up out of a brain, which is a headless accessible implementation
of the component. A UI component can be an Angular component or an Angular directive applied
to an existing HTML element or a combination of both if the UI component is more complicated.

On top of these brain components we put our helmet. Our helmet adds SPARTAN-like swagger to our UI.
Most of the time our helmets are added by applying the hlm + component name directive.
An example:
`<button hlmBtn >...</button>` this applies the SPARTAN styles to the button element.

Appearance only UI components that do not provide any other functionality are also
Angular components, e.g. the `<hlm-skeleton/>` component allows you to build a skeleton UI.
